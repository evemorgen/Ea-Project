# This repo contains code and docs regarding Evolutionary Algorithms project classes

## Project topic
Skew-symmetric version of Self Avoiding Walk  

##Milestone 1 
  1. Choose technology, programming language, environment
    - we have decided, we're going to go with [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org)
  2. Implement LABS and evaluation function
    - Labs and evaluation function can be found [here](src/main/scala/main.scala#L4)
  3. Try to understand your algorithm - implement it or write in pseudo code
    - following the [PDF](docs/LABS+emas+memetic_PL.pdf), the code can be written [as follows]()
